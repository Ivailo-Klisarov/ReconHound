# ReconHound
A web scraper that searches for potential useful information for a penetration tester like: company emails, potential input forms and boxes, technologies, login directrories and much more..

> **Note:** The name extractor relies on whatever values you place in `first_names.txt` and `last-names.txt`. If these wordlists contain common nouns (e.g., “Team”, “Travel”) they will be reported as names, so expect false positives unless you keep the lists limited to actual given names and surnames.
